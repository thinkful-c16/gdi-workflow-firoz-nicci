# GDI Course Manager - React Capstone

As a course organizer for a local organization that offers intro tech courses, I wanted to create a centralized way to manage the various resources (spreadsheets, Trello lists, HQ documents) needed to schedule and coordinate our training class offerings. I wanted a way for everyone on the Leadership Committee to see, at a glance, the scheduled courses and the progress of each toward being fully coordinated (designated coordinator, instructor, TAs, venue, Meetup.com event link).
